The more usual corruptions and deformations of the character’s humanity can cause Stains on their Humanity track. If too many Stains build up without repentance or redress, a character’s Humanity might drop. Track Stains by checking off spaces from right to left.

### Gaining a stain:
If a character acts in violation of a chronicle Tenet, the Storyteller weighs the severity of the violation. A clear but justifiable or less-than-appalling violation may only incur 1 Stain. A truly bestial act, on the other hand, may incur 2 or even more Stains. If the Tenet was violated in the service of a Conviction, reduce the Stains gained by one or more.

| Action                               | Stains |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Blood Bonding a mortal               | +1     |
| Embracing a mortal                   | +2     |
| Touchstone damaged                   | +1     |
| Touchstone damaged by your actions   | +2     |
| Touchstone destroyed                 | +2     |
| Touchstone destroyed by your actions | +3     |
### Removing a stain:
A character with any Stains marked on their Humanity track at the end of the session makes a Remorse check. Roll a number of dice equal to the unmarked, unfilled dots on the Humanity tracker; for example, a character with Humanity 6 and 2 Stains would roll two dice. The minimum number of dice in a Remorse roll is one; even if the whole track is full, the player can roll one die.

If the Remorse roll results in at least one success, the character has suffered enough guilt, shame, or regret to retain their current Humanity. They remove all Stains. If the Remorse roll results in no successes, the Beast has won. The character must lose 1 point of Humanity and then remove all Stains.

### Degeneration:
If a character accumulates more Stains than they have empty boxes on their Humanity track, they become Impaired (resulting in a two-dice penalty to all pools in this case), as they are overcome with regret. In addition, they take one point of Aggravated [[Willpower]] damage for each Stain that could not fit in the open boxes. In this state, the character is incapable of further intentional Tenet violations, and if forced to commit one, they must test for [[Frenzy#Terror Frenzy|terror frenzy]] at Difficulty 4. The Impaired condition remains until the end of the session, when Remorse is tested, as usual. The character can also choose to snap out of it by voluntarily losing a point of Humanity, wiping away the Stains as they rationalize their actions and accept what they’ve become.
