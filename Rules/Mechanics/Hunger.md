### How does it work?
In Vampire: The Masquerade, all vampires have a unique trait, Hunger, measured in levels ranging from 0 to 5. A vampire with a Hunger of 0 is sated and satisfied, whereas a vampire with a Hunger of 5 is ravenous and can barely think of anything except their next drink.

| Hunger Level | Notes                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0            | The only way to achieve this level is by draining a human entirely                                           |
| 1            | The only hunger you have is the constant thirst all kindred feel                                             |
| 2-3          | You are hungry                                                                                               |
| 4            | You are extremely hungry                                                                                     |
| 5            | You are ravenous for blood, failing a rouse check now will cause a hunger frenzy on a failed willpower check |
Hunger can be sated by [[Feeding]] which sometimes requires [[Hunting]].

### What are Hunger Dice?
For each level of Hunger affecting a vampire character, they gain one Hunger die. Hunger dice are ten-sided, just like regular dice but should be separately identifiable. When a player builds a dice pool for a vampire character, they exchange regular dice from that pool for Hunger dice on a one-for-one basis. If the dice pool for the roll is lower than the character’s Hunger, simply roll a number of Hunger dice equal to the dice pool.

Characters never include Hunger dice in Checks, Willpower, or Humanity dice pools.

Hunger dice function as regular dice in tests and contests, scoring successes on a 6 or higher. Hunger dice can not be re-rolled by using Willpower, however, as the Hunger makes a mockery of the rational mind’s attempt to tame it. In addition, rolling a 0 (10) or 1 on a Hunger die carries additional consequences: messy critical and bestial failures.

### What do they do?
Hunger dice contain the capacity to turn failures into bestial failures and to turn a critical into a messy critical. Difficulty of success is equal to the roll you are trying to make

| Roll | What is means                            |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Bestial failure if the test fails        |
| 2-9  | Regular roll                             |
| 10   | Messy critical if part of a critical win |

#### What is a messy critical?
A critical win in which one or more 10s appears on a Hunger die is a messy critical. The character succeeds as in a regular critical but like an animal would, not a being capable of foresight or self control. The Beast scored the critical, perhaps, not you.

#### What is a Bestial Failure?
A failed roll (not enough successes to reach the Difficulty or to beat an opposing contestant’s number of successes) in which one or mor e Hunger dice come up a 1 is a bestial failure. Either the character failed because their Beast manifested inopportunely or excessively, or the character’s failure angered their Beast into manifesting inopportunely or excessively.
