Vampires enter torpor in three ways: from Hunger, from damage, and voluntarily:

* If a vampire attempts to rise for the night with a Hunger level of 5 and fails their Rouse Check, they enter torpor.

* If a vampire takes enough Aggravated damage to fill their Health tracker completely, they automatically enter torpor. They then unconsciously attempt to mend damage, trying to heal one Health point per night. If they fully restore themselves (heal all Health damage, and mend or recover from all impediments or critical hits), they can rise again. If failed Rouse Checks to mend damage drive them above Hunger 5, they enter torpor as above.

* A vampire who entered torpor voluntarily still increases their Hunger every night, until they enter torpor as above. The same rules then apply.

To cut short a period of torpor, one can feed a slumbering vampire enough vampire Blood of higher Blood Potency than theirs to slake one Hunger.
