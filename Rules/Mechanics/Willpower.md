Willpower measures a character’s confidence, mental stability, and competence at overcoming unfavourable odds. Like Health, Willpower is a tracker, with both a maximum rating and a temporary pool of points. A character’s maximum Willpower rating equals their ==Composure + Resolve==. You cannot buy extra dots of Willpower either during character creation or with experience points, but you can get more through increased Composure and/or Resolve.

When spending a point of Willpower, mark it as Superficial damage with a / on the willpower tracker. A character with no Willpower points left is Impaired, receiving a -2 dice penalty to Social and Mental tests. They still get to roll one die if required to roll their pool, as per the usual rules.
### Spending Willpower:
A player may spend a point of Willpower for several different purposes:
* To re-roll up to three regular dice, (not Hunger dice) in any dice pool except when the rules specifically exclude Willpower re-rolls.
* To take control of your character for one turn during frenzy or when under the influence of supernatural coercion, such as Dominate or Presence.
* To perform minute movements (twitch a finger, open your eyes) while impaled with a wooden stake through the heart.
* To ignore Health damage penalties, including Impairment, for one turn.

### Rolling Willpower:
Willpower is most often a resource to be spent, however sometimes the rules declare that we should make a "Willpower Roll" or use a "Willpower Pool". For this refer to [[Willpower Check]].
### Recovering Willpower
Superficial Recovery:
* At the beginning of a night, a character can remove an amount of Superficial damage up to their Composure or Resolve (use highest) from their Willpower track.
* At the Storyteller’s discretion, once per session, a character who definitively acts to further their Desire may immediately recover 1 point of Superficial Willpower damage.
* At the Storyteller’s discretion, a character who plays out a messy critical, a bestial failure, a frenzy, or a Compulsion in a sufficiently dramatic way can recover one or more Superficial Willpower damage as they briefly satiate the Beast.

Aggravated Recovery:
* At the Storyteller’s discretion, a character can recover one or more points of Aggravated Willpower damage when acting to significantly benefit a Touchstone or uphold a Conviction against their own best interest.
* At the end of a session in which the character has actively worked toward their Ambition, they recover one point of Aggravated Willpower damage.
