### Feeding on Kindred:
Drinking from another vampire causes them to gain hunger in proportion to your reduction in hunger. 

If the target kindred is at least 2 levels of blood potency higher than you, hunger reduction is double the gain inflicted upon them. Conversely if the target kindred is at least 2 levels of blood potency lower than you, their hunger gain is double the reduction that you achieve.

#### Learning Disciplines:
Drinking the blood of another kindred is the only way to gain access to disciplines outside of your clan. After you have unlocked a discipline in this manner you do not immediately gain access to the discipline, you must invest in it by spending XP.

#### The Blood Bond:
A blood bond is created when a kindred or mortal feeds on the blood of a vampire roughly more than three times in a short period of time. This creates a sort of psychic servitude causing the drinker to become infatuated or obsessed with their master (regnant) against their will.

The Bond Strength is equal to the number of times the thrall has consumed the vitae of the regnant. The maximum level of Bond Strength is 6 and decreases by one each month the thrall does not consume the Blood. Should they wish to attempt something against their master's wishes the thrall must make a defiance test of Resolve + Intelligence vs. the current Bond Strength level. When the regnant is present in the scene, the test must be made once per turn. However, it is only made once per scene if the regnant is not present.

In order to break the Blood Bond, the thrall must have their Bond Strength reduced to 0 over time. The regnant might perhaps choose to start refusing to give them blood. However, if the regnant is actively searching and wishing to maintain the bond, the thrall must make the defiance test once per session to avoid them, or more often, should the Storyteller decide that the thrall is recalling the regnant in their mind

#### Diablerie:
Completely draining another vampire constitutes an act of diablerie, this is an immense risk but an immense potential reward. This act will permanently mark you to those that can see aura's.

Successfully committing an act of diablerie on a kindred of a lower generation than you will decrease your generation by one.
