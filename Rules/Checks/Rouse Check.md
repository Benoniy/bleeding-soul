Make a roll with a d10:
* 1-5 -- A fail, the kindred gains a point of hunger
* 6-0 -- A success, the kindred does not gain a point of hunger

After the roll you simply resolve the effects that prompted the rouse check, this check does not determine success or failure just hunger gain.

### Re-Rolling a rouse check: 
Kindred with high blood potency can re-roll a rouse check when that rouse check is related to using [[Disciplines]]. See [[Generations and Blood potency#Blood Potency Effects|Blood Potency Effects]] for details.
