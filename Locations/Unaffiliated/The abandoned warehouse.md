### Exterior:
The warehouse is made of crumbling red brick walls and rusty corrugated metal sheets for a roof which hang precariously; many of which are bent or missing revealing the interior. There are large, grimy windows which are mostly shattered, leaving jagged remnants or empty frames that again expose the interior. The walls have seen there fair share of graffiti and the heavy looking loading bay doors have all but rusted through. Additionally there is an entry door to the right of the loading bay doors.
### Interior:
The interior of the abandoned warehouse is a haunting scene of decay and neglect.  The air is dust-filled and rusted, cobweb-covered machinery fills the floor. Cracked concrete floors are strewn with broken crates, pallets, and puddles from ceiling leaks. The walls are peeling and faded, while rusty beams and corroded support columns support the roof. Debris piles in corners house scurrying rodents and insects, and faded safety signs hang limply. Old office spaces with broken glass partitions and overturned furniture stand as silent witnesses to the past, and the musty smell of decay mingles with rust and stale oil.
