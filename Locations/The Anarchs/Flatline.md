on malcom x boulevard 
### Exterior:
An unassuming and crappy-looking brick building in the bad part of town the building that seems mostly abandoned however for some reason the locks and doors are all still in good, albeit dirty condition. The entrance is in a side alley and is covered in graffiti; its a heavy metal door with a shutter at eye level.
### Interior:
The interior is an odd mix of industrial building and nightclub with the hall and cloakroom having concrete floors and raw brick walls and the main club having been updated to a proper EDM rave club. The centre floor packed with blood-bags and kindred alike is tiled with light up glass plates with the rest of the club rooms being floored with an easy to clean vinyl. At one end of the room is a small stage butted right up against the dance floor and behind that is a raised stand for a DJ. The entire room is complete with rave lighting and special effects equipment. On the right hand side is access to a bar that also sells drugs and finally on the left is access to VIP rooms.  
### Description:
* This place is owned by [[The Anarchs]] its both a feeding and meeting spot.
