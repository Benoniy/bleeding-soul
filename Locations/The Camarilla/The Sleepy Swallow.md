### Exterior:
Placed in a relatively nice part of town as all Camarilla associated properties are, this lounge is as classy as can be and heavily evokes the swinging 60s. On first glance it may be mistaken for an old theatre or cinema complete with glowing lights outlining a golden trim for a sign. The doors are dark, wooden and heavy.  Out front is a small seating area sheltered from the weather.
### Interior:

### Description:
* An extremely classy lounge owned by [[Reggie Cooke]] but most people come for the sensual [[Miki Mellow]].
