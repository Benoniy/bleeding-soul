***Clan: Ventrue***
Philanderer, conqueror. Solomon is ruthless bellow the surface. He may seem reasonable, regal and strong but never openly "kind". Its hard to tell what kind of man he is from an interaction, he is most definitely not welcoming and does not consider anyone his equal. He doesn't even sleep in the same room as his wife [[Amelia Winters]] as she is a possession to him. His goal is to usurp the Camarilla and install himself as a peerless "King".

He is very controlling in his relationship with his wife Amelia, she wonders if he ever actually did love her. Some time ago he managed to imprison a Malkavian Oracle; [[Harold the Mad Oracle]]

Part of [[The Monarchists]]
