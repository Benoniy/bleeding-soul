***Clan: Ventrue***
The unwilling wife of [[King Solomon]]. She does everything for him. He "saved" her and did provide a much better life, they fell in love but after so long she's realised that she is being emotionally tortured. Its been so long that she's now trapped in this viscous cycle where she acts as an appendage living to attend him. The relationship has degenerated so far to the point where she suffers sexual abuse, "Its not an act of love if you make her" although clearly he doesn't understand that.

She acts as a confidant, lover, nurse and slave. Not to mention as a "baby maker", although in the many years she has been trapped she has been unable to conceive. This is a relief to her because she fears the reality that they could have a son who would learn to be just like him or worse, a daughter that would end up a victim of their own father.

She has tried to run away at least once before but it doesn't work and she is punished, not in ways anyone would immediately notice.
