Captain Arthur "Art" Lockwood, in his early 40s, stands at 6'2" with a tall, muscular frame honed by years of rigorous training and combat. His dark hair, flecked with grey, is kept in a military cut, complementing his piercing blue eyes and strong jawline. His face, marked by a few scars, hints at past battles, both human and supernatural. Typically seen in tactical gear with a reinforced Kevlar vest, Art's appearance is both practical and intimidating. Off duty, he favours simple, functional clothing like dark jeans, a plain t-shirt, and a well-worn leather jacket. His stoic expression and commanding presence convey both the weight of his responsibilities and his authoritative demeanour, earning respect and providing reassurance to his team.

Note: Billy Butcher voice, not much range of emotion
