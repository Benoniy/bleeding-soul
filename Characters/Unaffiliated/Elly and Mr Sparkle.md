***Clan: Malkavian***
A mysterious figure that wears a full black fur-suit upon closer inspection the suit can either appear completely normal, clean and respectable or horrific and made of actual raw dog skin.  
  
Upon being turned it just so happened that this Malkavian spotted a picture of their childhood dog, It didn't take long for the madness network to kick in and obviously they began to believe that the voices were the spirit of their dead dog. After a few months they happened to spot a fur-suit on Ebay for only $300, it began to speak to them begging them to buy it. Being a Malkavian they instantly believed it was their dog's actual skin and further believed that wearing the skin of their childhood friend seemed like a really good idea. Do they have schizophrenia or do you?
