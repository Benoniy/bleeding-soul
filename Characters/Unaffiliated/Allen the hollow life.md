***Clan: Nosferatu***
A Nosferatu running from his problems, he considers his life hollow at this point. In life he disliked the shallowness of superficial people and now he is forced to be as un-genuine as they were in order to survive. This is the exact kind of person that should never have been turned. He broke the masquerade immediately to interact with his mortal love interest, they are his obsession. His only goal is a normal life, something he is unsure if he can ever even have. He was turned and abandoned immediately, he knows nothing and is surviving off of pure luck and instinct. Needless to say his relationship with his mortal love interest is more than complicated, they are intensely scared of him but can't bring themselves to let him suffer. They provide blood but always in a way that avoids direct contact, through a crack in a window or through the letterbox in their door. Sometimes they talk through the door but when approached in the open, the fear takes hold and they run. Allen never forces the issue, he would never hold them against their will or force the situation but he will approach them the hope that one day they may just accept him again in a less than horrified way.

Truly he is the quintessential "cursed soul" archetype, a monster that is revolted by himself but a kind soul that never deserved any of this.

Note: Nosferatu's would consider Allen a "cleopatra" someone who was turned by force simply as a cruel joke. It's the case that he was likely stalked by a Nos that was disgusted by or jealous of his life.
