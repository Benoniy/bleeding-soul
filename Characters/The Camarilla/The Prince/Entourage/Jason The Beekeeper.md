***Clan: Gangrel***
A quiet man who oddly speaks in bee metaphors excessively. His bald with a small amount of stubble and a lean yet muscular build.

He used to do [[Raymond Pimb]]'s dirty work but after many years of service retired to a more comfortable role. Being Ray's bodyguard is more convenient for him and allows him to pursue a hobby he had during life, Beekeeping.
