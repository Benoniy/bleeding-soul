***Clan: Toreador***
A fiery red headed woman often seen wearing a complementing red dress. She is surly and passion / seduction drips off of her. She works at [[The Sleepy Swallow]].

Miki is a pretty standard toreador. She works as the main attraction of [[The Sleepy Swallow]], lounge singing and thereby charming the men that come to see her. Like a spider her prey comes to her and she is more than happy with the arrangement.
