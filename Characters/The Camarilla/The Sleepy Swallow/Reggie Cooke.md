***Clan: Toreador***
This man is a true lover, not a fighter. He is not as concerned with the aesthetics of others as most toreador are, having said that... Having a Nos in front of him might put him off a little. A true jazz man. Tall dark and handsome, exemplifying the idea of all toreador that beauty and style are power. Owner and proprietor of [[The Sleepy Swallow]].

Reggie has been a vampire for a while and during that time he's been a willing member of the camarilla; having said that, he is in fact less concerned with sides and more concerned with living a peaceful life. he is a corner-stone of the community and knows a lot of people.
