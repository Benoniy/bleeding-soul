***Clan: Brujha***
A man weathered by age, he was turned quite late in his life leaving him with the appearance of a 60-70 year old man. He has a strong moustache and a mullet, he wears a checkered shirt over a white vest and blue jeans. He also wears a baseball cap.

Ricky Khan has been the leader of The Anarchs in this city for as long as anyone can remember, he seems to have met [[Raymond Pimb]] quite early on in his un-life and that experience has led him to be more aligned with the camarilla than most anarchs. Having said that; as a Brujha there are some fight he wont lay down for and so compromise on the part of [[The Camarilla]] is something that is sometimes forced on them due to his strong relationship with the prince.
