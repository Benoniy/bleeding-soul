[[Mortal-NPC]]

Clergy comprise a varied group, spanning multiple faiths and each posing a danger to the Kindred. At their weakest, they are capable of rallying the kine in worship, hope, and resilience against undead predation. At their strongest, they wield their faith like a weapon, burning the flesh from vampires by holding aloft their religious icons and rebuking the dead.
