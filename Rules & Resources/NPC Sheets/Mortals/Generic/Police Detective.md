[[Mortal-NPC]]

An officer of the law is unlikely to investigate a vampire for being a vampire. After all, most Kindred keep their undead nature a secret under the Tradition of the Masquerade. However, a vampire who goes around breaking the law, assaulting kine, breaking and entering, or committing fraud to furnish their haven may well fall afoul of mortal law enforcement.
