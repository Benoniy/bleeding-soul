[[Inquisition-NPC]]

The Second Inquisition knows the broad details of Kindred society, thanks to the penetration of SchreckNET and a decade of successful interrogations and surveillance missions. It dispatches its agents into the field with set missions: spy, research, capture, or kill. They are each equipped appropriately to best handle their assigned role.
