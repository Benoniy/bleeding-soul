### Rouse Checks:
Every night you wake up you must make a [[Rouse Check]] to see if you gain hunger, you can also use the opportunity to heal aggravated damage by making three [[Rouse Check]]'s

If a kindred gains a hunger of over 5 when making their rouse checks waking up, the failure sends the vampire into [[Torpor]] instead of forcing a test for [[Frenzy#Hunger Frenzy|hunger frenzy]].

### Willpower:
At the beginning of a night, a character can remove an amount of Superficial damage up to their Composure or Resolve (use highest) from their Willpower track.
