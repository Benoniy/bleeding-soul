A vampire in frenzy loses all capacity for rational thought, driven solely by rage, starvation, or panic. They do whatever it takes to rip their provocation to pieces, slake their Hunger, or escape the perceived threat, usually violently and with plenty of collateral damage. Unlike many other impulses of the Blood, a frenzy is never subtle.

To resist frenzy, the vampire rolls a [[Willpower Check]] against a Difficulty set by the Storyteller based on the level of provocation. Vampires add dice equal to one-third of their Humanity (rounded down) to their [[Willpower Check]] pool when resisting frenzy.

A vampire resists frenzy on a normal win but must spend a turn to suppress the impulse. On a critical win, they resist the frenzy without losing a turn.

### Riding the wave:
A vampire can also choose to Ride the Wave, intentionally succumbing to the frenzy without making a test. This act follows the usual frenzy rules, though the Storyteller should let the player play out the frenzy themselves, such as choosing who they feed on first, rather than having the Story teller take complete control of the character.

If not Riding the Wave, a vampire in frenzy becomes the property of the Storyteller for the duration.

### Effects of frenzy:
While in frenzy, vampires remain immune to any Health-based penalties short of mutilation. They can only use physical Disciplines (such as Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence), but they resist mental disciplines (e.g., Dominate, Presence) with three extra dice added to their resistance pools. (If the Discipline has no resistance pool, the user adds +2 to their Difficulty.)

The player can spend a [[Willpower]] point to assume control of their character for a single turn while in frenzy, but may not use [[Willpower]] to re-roll dice.

The frenzied vampire cannot be provoked into frenzy by another stimulus, nor can they gain Compulsions. They try to achieve their goal at any cost (see Types of Frenzy, below), and their frenzy remains until they do so or until the scene ends.

#### Fury Frenzy:
A vampire in fury frenzy stops at nothing to tear the cause of the provocation to pieces, often together with anyone nearby: friend or foe. After destroying the subject of their ire, the vampire can make a [[Willpower]] test at Difficulty 3 (or 5 if other enemies remain standing). Success ends the frenzy, while failing drives them deeper into the rage; they keep slaying anyone in the vicinity unless subdued.

#### Hunger Frenzy:
During a hunger frenzy, the vampire seeks fresh human blood from the closest source. (If the closest source is their Touchstone, one hopes the player still has some [[Willpower]] to spend to take control of the vampire and send them after a different target.) The hunger frenzy ends when the vampire reaches Hunger 1 or below.

#### Terror Frenzy:
While in terror frenzy, the vampire flees from the source of danger, without regard to anyone or anything in their way. The terror frenzy ends when the vampire can no longer perceive any danger or when the scene ends.
