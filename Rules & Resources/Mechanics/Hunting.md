The simplest and fastest way to handle a hunt in-game resolves it with a single roll of the pool given for the characterâ€™s Predator type, or for another plausible approach a custom check can be mage.

Kindred that have herds or a retainer can feed without difficulty from them.

### Simple Hunting:
#### Dice Pools:

| Predator Type | Dice Pools                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alleycat      | Wits + Streetwise to find a victim if the character has a specific type.<br>Strength + Brawl to feed. |

| Farmer        | Composure + Animal Ken                                                                                |
| Osiris        | Manipulation + Subterfuge or Intimidation + Fame                                                      |

| Scene-Queen   | Manipulation + Persuasion                                                                             |
| Siren         | Charisma + Subterfuge                                                                                 |
#### Difficulty:
Difficulty should be changed based on the target and location.

### Advanced Hunting:

A Gangrel might suggest a harrowing chase across the park (Stamina + Athletics), while a Nosferatu prefers to wait like a trap-door spider in the refuse of a dark alley to feed on the inevitable passing druggie or drunk (Resolve + Stealth). However the roll is determined, the player makes a simple test against the Difficulty of their chosen hunting ground.
