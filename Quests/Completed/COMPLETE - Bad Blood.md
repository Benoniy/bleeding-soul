---
### Scene 1:
On arrival to the garden the prince will be found in dungarees gardening. He will introduce himself personably and compliment on Ron's fine work, he will take special care to flatter Kate.

After pleasantries he will explain that he has a job for the players and that it can be thought of as one of a few trust-building jobs before a large task.

He will explain the job (the pales) and provide the players with pins used by the camarilla to enter the hospital through the loading bay at the back and a list of the shipments that were contaminated. Then he will wish them well and send them on their way.

***High perception / insight can show:***
* A dead body peeking from under the soil
* A very well maintained garden
* His genuine hope that you prove to be reliable
* He definitely has a bigger reason for all of this

### Scene 2:
Behind the hospital is very bare, the players can see the door the prince told them to use. They will receive a warm welcome, the pales worship Kindred. They will be led to a counter where they will meet [[Garry Wells]] who mans the blood bank, they will be offered blood and he will freely give them access to any location they desire.

The main locations they can go are:
* The blood testing lab
	* Contains samples of each blood batch for the last 6 months, when analysed the blood shows signs of tampering
	* Contains records of blood batches and the associated dates tested as well as the tester, this will show that the contaminated blood was all tested by [[Jessie Marsh (DEAD)]]
	* Contains tools to test the substance and quality of blood
* The morgue
	* Nothing here
* Behind the counter
	* Contains a sign-in sheet as well as employee time-sheets, This will show that [[Jessie Marsh (DEAD)]] will be on shift in the next hour.
	* Contains [[Jessie Marsh (DEAD)]]'s locker which in turn contains a holy cross and a religious pamphlet. It also contains some of his payslips that list his address. (Apartment 17, Cityscape Heights, Maple St.)
* The loading bay
	* Contains shipment records, observed carefully they will reveal small amounts of silver nitrate (such small amounts are strange for a hospital to order). This was used to poison the blood.

### Scene 3 - Finale:
After discovering that the culprit was [[Jessie Marsh (DEAD)]], a pathologist who accidentally discovered that the blood was being server to Kindred. Realising the existence of vampires he became radicalised in his beliefs.

When he arrives he will be immediately suspicious and paranoid. If the players aren't careful he will flee for the loading bay where he will attempt leave.

***If he does not get away:***
he will attempt to initialise combat, the players must then neutralise them.

***If he does get away:***
[[Garry Wells]] will show them [[Jessie Marsh (DEAD)]]'s locker behind the counter leading them to his apartment. Im-proper handling could cause a masquerade breach at this point.
