[[Mortal-NPC]]

Ghouls form the stock of retainers, servants, and slaves of many Kindred. Addicted to the vitae in their masters’ and mistresses’ dead veins, ghouls will obey their creators in any way they can, even to the point of injury, and in some cases, death. Ghouls may be stoic butlers, steady bodyguards, or blood-crazed savages, depending on their regnant.
