[[Mortal-NPC]]

Perhaps hailing from the enigmatic Society of St. Leopold, perhaps a local imam assisting an investigative team, this old-school inquisitor believes in faith and fire. Likely with extensive contacts among the churches of the world, and comparably great insight into the foe, this antagonist is as cunning as it is relentless.
